				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					15 years of accounting experience now being used to create my mark in
					the digital sector. Attending Leeds digital festival in 2017 opened my
					eyes to the possibilities coding had to offer and I decided to follow
					my desire to become a keen learner, collaborating and sharing in this
					sector. With over 6 years experience of working with stakeholders,
					developing innovative solutions to produce absorbing content gave me
					the perfect foundation to bolt the technical skills of coding too.
					Working as a coder for the past 4 years I have acquired the
					fundamental skills of front end and back end web development.
				</p>
				<p>
					With a constant desire to simplify the process to complete a given
					task, I have cultivated a knowledge of best practice for most
					scenarios and regularly receive positive feedback from users on my
					work. I enjoy how full-stack development gives me the skills to
					rapidly go from ‘discussion’ to ‘concept’ to ‘deployment’, as my
					knowledge grows this becomes even more enjoyable.

					years of experience and clinical approach reduces the bottlenecks I am

					I am seeking the opportunity to work closely with the senior team and
					be an integral part of the projects released. In return you gain a
					passionate individual who is keen to grow with the department, years
					of softs skills harnessed ready to work closely with users to exceed
					their expectations. I complement these skills with a constant desire
					to learn and evolve where I never back down from a challenge and enjoy
					the opportunity to learn and share.
